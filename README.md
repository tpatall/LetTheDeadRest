# Let The Dead Rest
Lowers the volume of alive players while you are dead.

When other players join you in the afterlife their voice volume will be set back to normal. When you are revived or respawn at the end of a day, everyone's volume will also be set back to normal.

So you can talk in peace with your fellow dead comrades about their life... uh death?

## Config Settings
Using LethalConfig you can change the value (0.0 to 1.0 multiplier of normal volume) anytime while in-game. 

You can also find the setting in the config file: `dummy.LetTheDeadRest.cfg`

- **Volume Multiplier** (default = 0.2)
	- How loud alive players are compared to your fellow dead players. From 0.0 to 1.0.
